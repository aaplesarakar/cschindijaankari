                                    <P><strong>NPS offers two categories of accounts as of now:</strong></P>
                                    <p> <strong>Tier 1: Meant for retirement savings:</strong> NPS Tier I account is a
                                        mandatory account and
                                        is meant to save up for retirement. When you open an NPS Tier I account, you get
                                        a
                                        Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN). You have to make a minimum
                                        contribution
                                        of Rs. 500 while opening a Tier I account.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The minimum contribution to be made in Tier I account per annum is Rs. 1,000.
                                        However, note that there is no ceiling on the maximum contribution. The NPS Tier
                                        1 account matures at the age of 60 and you can extend it till the age of 75. It
                                        is eligible for tax deduction on contributions up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section
                                        80 C and an additional Rs 50,000 under Section 80 CCD (1B) of the Income Tax
                                        Act, 1961</p>
                                    <p><strong>Tier II: Meant for general investment:</strong> NPS Tier II account is a
                                        voluntary account
                                        which can be opened only when you have a Tier I account. It is an account with
                                        flexible withdrawal and exit rules. Though Tier II account works almost like
                                        Tier I account, there are certain differences.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To open an NPS Tier II account, you need to make a minimum contribution of Rs.
                                        1000, and unlike Tier I account, contributions to Tier II account don’t qualify
                                        for any tax exemption, you can’t claim deductions and on exit, the corpus is
                                        taxed. Tier II account is more like a bank account that you can use to meet your
                                        needs in a holistic manner.

                                        1. NPS account can be operated from anywhere in the country irrespective of

                                        Government or vice versa or All Citizen Model to Corporate Model and vice versa.
                                        Hence a citizen (individual) can move to Central Government, State Government
